We use conda to create the virtual environment. To install conda you can follow the official [documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). 
```
conda create -n synaptic_plasticity python=3.9 nb_conda_kernels
conda activate synaptic_plasticity 
```

**3. Install the required dependencies:** <br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
